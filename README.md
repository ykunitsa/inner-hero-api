# Inner Hero App API
This is a web and mobile application designed to help individuals practice exposure therapy for anxiety using the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) methods. The application allows users to face their fears gradually and track their progress. It also provides therapists with tools to administer and monitor the exposure process.

## Features:
* Exposure Training: Users can engage in exposure exercises by choosing situations that cause anxiety and working through a series of gradual steps to reduce fear.
* Step-by-Step Exposure: Each exposure includes multiple steps, starting from less anxiety-inducing actions to more challenging ones.
* Timer for Steps: Some steps include a timer (e.g., "look at something for 5 minutes"), which the user must complete to finish the step.
* Therapist Administration: Therapists can create and manage situations and exposure steps, allowing them to customize exposure training for each user.
* Progress Tracking: Users can mark steps as completed and track their progress over time.
